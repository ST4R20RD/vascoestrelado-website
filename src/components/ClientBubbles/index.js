              " The photography in publications about cars in Portugal is a little gray, always
              focusing on formulas and visual techniques that are old, most often, give an outdated
              and sad tone.
              <br />
              The photos of Vasco are giving a new life to this area. Visually appealing and
              aesthetic details show unusual and great technical knowledge, which puts his work at
              the level of what is made in the most recognized car magazines in the world."

              And in the end when we see the photos is made we can't believe that is what he was
              doing. No matter, in what conditions, rain, cold, lack of time or of good location he
              always make it happen, no Mather what, the end result it's always amazing."

              Throughout this time we found some, one is, without a shadow of doubt, our friend
              Vasco Estrelado. Since its help in the Niobo Roadshow held in Lisbon, the videos
              directed and produced by him, their advice was in fact the most valuable for us . It
              has been a very interesting partnership that has and will continue to grow. Our many
              thanks.
